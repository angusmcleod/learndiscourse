**Hitman forum**
Is the community for fans of the 'Hitman' series of video games.
We've been around for a decade (since the first game) and switched from a classic forum (IPB) to discourse.

On an unrelated note -I also did some CSS customisation, but nothing drastic.

Hi, @ampburner, your forum looks fantastic :smile:

I haven't found any `how-to` post that explains how to add a tab like the one you have added, called `IOI Tracker` and showing the content from a specific group.

Can someone explain how to do that?
Thanks!
