# Badges

Badges in Discourse reinforce positive user behaviour and facilitates "learning by doing". It is a central part of Discourse's [gamification](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/) features.

There are two ways to receive a badge:

1. Manually granted by an administrative user
2. Automatically granted by the system

Furthermore, all badges have some optional properties.

- Allow badge to be used as a title
- Can be granted multiple times
- Show badge on the public badges page
- Show post granting badge on badge page


### Creating Badges

Manual and automatic badges are [created the same way](#admin). What sets them apart is how they're triggered.

### Manual Badges

A badge can only be granted by an administrative user. See [how to manually grant a badge](#admin).

### Automatic Badges

Automatic badges are granted by special triggers. Discourse comes with a lot of default badges out of the box, but administrative users can also create custom ones. At their most basic, automatic badges are simple "kudos!" for users who are just starting out.

For example:

- Added a link
- Received a like.

Certain badges also coincide with new [trust levels](#). When you've attained a new trust level, you'll receive a corresponding badge to notify you of the bump-up.

- Trust Level 1 --> Basic
- Trust Level 2 --> Member
- Trust Level 3 --> Regular
- Trust Level 4 --> Leader
