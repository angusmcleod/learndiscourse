# What success looks like

# Step by step 

### Flagged organizations

As we move along, when we identify organizations that have an issue, we make a note in the staff notes and change the core status to FLAGGED FOR REVIEW. These need to be reviewed on a regular basis. 

- open up insight dashboard, organizations tab
- filter by FLAGGED FOR REVIEW  
- click through to each organization on the list to read the staff notes to figure out what action is needed
- take the appropriate action, e.g. 
  - fix contact details, website links, logo, description etc 
  - identify network champion for organization 
  - update core member details 
- start (or update existing) discourse message to the person with the appropriate ticket tags.
