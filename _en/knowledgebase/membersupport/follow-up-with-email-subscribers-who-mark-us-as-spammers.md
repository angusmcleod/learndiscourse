title: Follow up with email subscribers who mark us as spammers
---

Unfortunately, some users may mark our emails as spam. For example, let&rsquo;s say a user unsubscribes from our mailchimp mailing list, but does not unsubscribe from Discourse or request we close his account. When this happens, the user will still receive our Discourse digests and may mark them as spam, thinking they already unsubscribed from all emails.

WHY THIS MATTERS: This is potentially serious because it might affect our reputation as a newsletter sender, resulting in more of our mail landing in spam folders even for those who want to read it and don't see our mail as spam.

WHAT TO DO: If someone marks us as spam, please follow the procedure below:

1. Disable the user&rsquo;s Discourse digest mode so that they stop receiving email digests

2. Send the user a personal email to see if they want to remain a member, invite them to update their email notification preferences, and let them know that we will delete their account for them if we don&rsquo;t hear back within 1 week (*see template below)

3. Wait 1 week, then:

   1. IF the user has NOT contributed to Discourse or Wordpress, simply delete their account

   2. IF the user HAS contributed to Discourse or Wordpress, we will do the following:

    1. Try harder to get them back in the Network before deleting them -- ask Abby and other staff to help us reach out with a second personal email urging them to return

    2. If no response within 1 week after this second email, we will have to &ldquo;anonymize user&rdquo; in Discourse, as we can&rsquo;t actually delete them completely if they have posts

### Email template for first email post-spam marking:

> Dear XX,
> 
> My name is YY and I am the AA [position] for Namati. I am reaching out because we noticed that you recently marked one of our emails as spam, but you have not deactivated your account with the Network (which is why you have continued to receive email updates). We understand if you want to receive fewer emails, so I have removed you from our email digests list.
> 
> However, I want to make sure that we sort out your account preferences so that there are no further problems. Do you wish to remain a member of the Global Legal Empowerment Network? Remember, there are many benefits of membership, including a curated library of 800+ legal empowerment resources, a searchable directory of members and organizations, a unique discussion platform for activists, and opportunities to take part in learning exchanges and advocacy campaigns. If you want to remain a member but not receive any emails, we can easily update your preferences, just let me know. You can also do this yourself by visiting your Dashboard [here](http://namati.org/network/dashboard/), selecting &ldquo;Preferences,&rdquo; and updating the boxes under &ldquo;Email.&rdquo;
> 
> That said, we understand if you would like to end your membership, though you will be missed. If we do not hear back from you within 1 week, we will delete your account for you. Please know that you can easily register again at any time.
> 
> Yours in solidarity,
> 
> YY
