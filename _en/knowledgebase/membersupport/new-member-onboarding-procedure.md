# What success looks like

[bgcolor=yellow]Still have to iron out the details, but generally i think this procedure can work:[/bgcolor] 

In a nutshell: 

- for every new member, we have done cursory review of their profile details. This should be a quick process. Just check that the username reflects them (and not their organization) and updated as needed. Also check links and improve if possible. Fix typos in bio and other details as needed. 
- if the new member has added an organization affiliation, the organization profile is also checked 
  - does it meets the guidelines and looks it best? If any changes are made, a note is added to the org profile staff notes. 
- new members are sent a welcome message automatically by the system. typically we ignore this unless they reply (in which case we follow up) or unless we have made improvements or if you think the member is core member eligible, reply to the welcome message that is automatically sentto let them know and to explain core membership and share the link. 
- if no changes, ignore
