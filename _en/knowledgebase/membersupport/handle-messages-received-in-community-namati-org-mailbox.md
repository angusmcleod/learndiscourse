# What success looks like

- We are responsive. We respond quickly to requests, even if just to let people know we got the message and are working on it. 
- We do not drop any balls - every opportunity is taken. Whenever follow-up is needed, we create tickets in the forum, assign them to the appropriate person on our team, and get help with triaging from others on the team. 
- We are thorough. When triaging how to respond, we check salesforce and wordpress/discourse. We update our records and leave notes to inform our future selves of action taken whenever possible. 
- We are "movement generous". Wherever possible, we share what we receive by email on the forum. We use the network to source solutions that can help to people who write to us by email for help (including posting legal aid requests, being careful to exclude any sensitive/personal info as needed)
- Members move to the forum to communicate with us and each other
- Non-members join the network 
- Content received by email is shared on the forum
