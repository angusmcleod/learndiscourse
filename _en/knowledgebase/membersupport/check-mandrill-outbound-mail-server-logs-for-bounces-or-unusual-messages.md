title: Check Mandrill outbound mail server logs for bounces or unusual messages
---

 - Log into http://mandrillapp.com using mailchimp admin password, and slect OUTBOUND on the menu on left to see a list of emails sent through our system, newest at the top.
- scroll through the list to review messages sent in the last last week and look for any with hard or soft bounce status. These potentially have typos or have changed, and so are no longer working. 
- investigate and fix any issues you come across in Wordpress. You may need to follow up with a member by email or discourse PM to find out whatâ€™s going wrong with their email delivery.
- if nothing can be done, follow the [steps to take when a member email address stops working](https://community.namati.org/t/steps-to-take-when-a-member-email-address-stops-working-procedure/41156?u=tobiaseigen)

It looks like this in mandrill - note I am filtering by "hard bounces" which just shows the latest bounced messages in the list. These are the ones that need investigating most urgently.
