title: "Help member add their organization to the Network directory: procedure"
---

Members can add their organizations at signup or when editing their profiles. Or we can add their organizations on their behalf. Either way, we want to use discourse messaging to communicate with them and help them. You can write messages like the one below.

To add a new organization on behalf of a member:

1. Log in and add new content of post type organization: http://namati.org/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=organization
   * Complete all the fields appropriately with information received from the organization or from their website
   * Be sure to select a member as the wordpress author (pulldown on bottom right corner)
   * upload logo as &quot;featured image&quot;
   * Fields to ignore: salesforce, content permissions, excerpt

2. Edit the member(s) and set their organizational affiliation

3. Send discourse message to the members to let them know, providing links to their new org profile page

## Message to member suggesting they add their org affiliation

> Please add WANA Institute to the network organization directory
> 
> Hello again! Having reviewed your Network profile, I realized that you have not yet added your organization to the organization directory. The directory is a great way to enable other members and website visitors to find and connect with your organization.
> 
> Let me know if you'd like me to add it for you based on the information on the website athttp://wanainstitute.org/en - or if you prefer you can add it yourself by editing your network profile. Here's how you'd do it:
> 
> 1. Log in and go to http://namati.org/network/dashboard/
> 
> 2. Click on EDIT PROFILE
> 
> 3. Scroll down to &quot;Organizational Affiliation&quot; at the bottom and select &quot;Add new organization&quot;
> 
> 4. Fill in all the details about your organization in as much detail as you can. This information will be presented on your organization profile page.
> 
> While you are in there, please review and complete information about yourself personally as well, including website links and biographical information. This will appear on your network profile page.
> 
> Please let me know if you have any questions at all.
