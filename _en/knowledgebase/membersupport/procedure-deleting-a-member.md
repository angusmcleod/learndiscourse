title: "Procedure: Deleting a member"

If you come across a spam user account, a test account, or if someone has requested their account be removed, you can delete them if you have the appropriate privileges/capabilities. It happens in two places - WordPress and Discourse. 

### 1. Delete account in WordPress 

Log in as admin, search for user in namati.org/wp-admin/users.php and use the DELETE button on the user list to delete. 

Note: be careful not to delete any content unintentionally. If you choose to delete all content you may be surprised! You can also attribute it to another user - presumably the NAMATI user. 

### 2 Delete account in Discourse 

Log in as admin, search for user and go to profile page, select ADMIN, scroll to bottom to delete the user. 

Note: if the user has posted alot already, you may choose to ANONYMIZE the user instead, so the account is removed but posts remain anonymized. 

### TBD Salesforce? Mailchimp? 

do we also need to have a procedure for removing contacts from Salesforce?  

Subscribers from Mailchimp? (maybe this we can leave to the subscribers to do for themselves)
