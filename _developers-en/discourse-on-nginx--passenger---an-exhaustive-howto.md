Just finished the [monster blog entry](http://blog.bigdinosaur.org/setting-up-discourse-with-passenger-and-nginx/) that I've been saying I was going to write forever and ever on setting up Discourse on Nginx + Passenger. It includes just about everything I've learned so far about getting Discourse up in production, including how to daemonize Sidekiq and Clockwork instead of having to rely on bluepill.

Enjoy :smiley:
